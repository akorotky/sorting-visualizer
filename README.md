# Sorting Visualizer
Sorting visualizer is a tool for visualizing array sorting algorithms. 

I made this project to help me and others learn more about sorting algorithms and to better understand how they work. 

So far the project allows to visualize the following algorithms:
* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Heapsort
* Mergesort
* Quicksort
* Counting Sort
* Introsort (3 variants) 
* Shellsort
* Cocktail Shaker Sort
* Bitonic Sort

This project was bootstrapped using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)
