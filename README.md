# Sorting Visualizer
Sorting visualizer is a tool for visualizing array sorting algorithms. 

I made this project to help me and others learn more about sorting algorithms and to better understand how they work. 

So far the project allows to visualize the following algorithms:
* Insertion Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Quicksort
* Mergesort
* Heapsort
* Introsort (3 variants) 

And I am going to add more sorting algorithms when I can. 

This project was bootstrapped using [Vite.js](https://vitejs.dev/)
